# websocket-chat
Chat application based on websocket and Java spring rest api. (I dont know how to create websocket client with java, so im trying to make web app with js)

Same functionality as [client](https://github.com/Dylag/sample-chat-app-client/projects) and [server](https://github.com/Dylag/sample-chat-app-server) (except chatting) with another implementation
